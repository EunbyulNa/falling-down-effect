# Falling down effect 

# 1. How it works 
Welcome, winter :) Random size of snow flakes are falling down on your screen 

# 2. What I learned 
 - appendChild() : The appendChild() method appends a node (element) as the last child of an element. <br>
 In this project I append snowflake i tag inside the body 
- setTimeout() : It calls a function after a number of milliseconds. (1 second = 1000milliseconds) <br>
I used setTimeout to prevnet overloading snowflakes on the screen
